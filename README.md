ControlStadia is a Chrome Extension which allows arbitrary mapping of input devices to a "standard" virtual input controller which works with Stadia!

With ControlStadia, you can:

* Map up to four physical gamepads to a single "standard" virtual gamepad which works with Stadia.
* Scale and offset axis to increase or decrease sensitivity, change axis ranges.
* Do normal things like playing GRID with a steering wheel and pedals!
* Do ridiculous things like playing Borderlands 3 with a flight yoke and throttle quadrant!

## Demo

## Usage
Simply [install the extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/controlstadia/faodiopjdcjfeflfmeadfkgodcbioejp) and open or refresh Stadia! Click the extension icon to configure your virtual joypad.

Once the extension menu is open, it should automatically look for any joysticks plugged into your PC. If none show up, try pressing a button or moving a stick on one.

Once the mapping controls appear, you can now set each button and axis for the virtual gamepad. The "target gamepad" at selected at the top is the gamepad which will be scanned for input when you click on a mapping button. If you want to include controls from multiple gamepads, make sure you switch this target option to the correct one BEFORE pressing a mapping button.

The "Scale" field will multiply input by the factor specified. For example, setting this to two will cause the joystick to become twice as sensitive, but also lose twice its range of motion, since ControlStadia caps axis values to the range `[-1, 1]`. You can also use a negative scale to invert the axis.

The "Offset" field will add a constant value to the input.

ControlStadia has manifest permissions to run on [gamepad-tester.com](https://gamepad-tester.com), where you can view the output values of the virtual controller. I highly recommend setting up your virtual controller while on this page!

## Xbox cloud support
This extension can also be used on Xbox Cloud, but at the moment it is primarily builded for Stadia.

### Scale and offset example
Say you're trying to map <kbd>R2</kbd> to a controller axis that ranges from `[-1, 1]`. Because <kbd>R2</kbd> expects a value in the range `[0, 1]`, we must both scale and offset the axis. In this case, the scale would be `0.5` (changing the range to `[-0.5, 0.5]`) and the offset would be `0.5`, (changing the range to `[0, 1]`).

## Latency
ControlStadia adds a bit of latency to control inputs. I'm actively working to minimize this as much as possible!

## Pull requests
All pull requests are welcome! Please feel free to improve ControlStadia as you see fit, there's many improvements to be made!
